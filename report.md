# Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Project 2: Continuous Control
Starter code and project details can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/p2_continuous-control).

## Agents
This section covers all the RL Agents that were implemented to solve goal for this environment. Each section will have an explanation of the agent and neural network used by that agent,
a graph showing the results of that agents learning in the environment, and references to the papers relevant to that agent.
